# üí´ About Me
I've spent the last seven years in the trenches as a senior full-stack and blockchain engineer. My specialty is cutting through the complexity to build robust, scalable solutions‚Äîwhether that's a sleek web app or a novel smart contract system.

I'm a natural collaborator and a pragmatic problem-solver. I thrive in teams that are building something meaningful and enjoy working directly with clients to make sure what we build not only works but actually moves the needle. I stick around to make sure it's done right.
